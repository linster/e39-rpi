BMW e39 IBUS Raspberry Pi App

Ths program listens to the steering wheel Previous & Next track inputs, and routes those to a paired Bluetooth phone to change the track in Google Play Music. 

Where there has been previous research and work done to interface with the BMW IBus (a LIN bus), I am the first to do it with Kotlin using co-routines, flows, and channels.
